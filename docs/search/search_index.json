Start Invoking the Experience","title":"Prepping your Android Project"},{"location":"android/invoking-sdk/","text":"Invoking the SDK PayPal can either watch the WebView in the application, and provide a native payment experience in place of a website or can be invoked directly by calling a simple function. You can integrate manually into the application using the super easy steps below. Setup the Environment The SDK needs some additional information about the application before it can be invoked. Take a look at the // Register the activity context. final PayPalCheckoutConfig paypalEnvironment = PayPalCheckoutConfig.getInstance(this); // Set the client ID of the app. paypalEnvironment.setClientId(\"AX93NErgg-sampleClientID_registeredForTheApplication-VD4GP-AJdjT0Uz4\"); // Set the URI scheme/app link registered in the PayPal Developer Portal as a Return URL and defined for `com.paypal.openid.RedirectUriReceiverActivity` activity in the AndroidManifest.xml file. paypalEnvironment.setPayPalRedirectURL(\"sampleapp://paypalpay\"); // This is optional if using URI schemes as a Return Url. // This is mandatory if app links are used as a Return Url. // If set, the value should match the scheme provided for the `com.paypal.pyplcheckout.activities.PYPLInitiateCheckout` activity in the AndroidManifest.xml file. paypalEnvironment.setPayPalUrlScheme(\"sampleapp\"); // The environment is set to LIVE by default. Use this only for internal testing. paypalEnvironment.setPayPalEnvironment(PayPalEnvironment.SANDBOX); Integration Steps for Web Intercept WebView Intercept If the preceeding integration has collisions with code around the WebView, manual intercepting of the WebView is possible, as shown in these examples. PayPalWebViewUtils.getInstance().shouldOverrideUrlLoading(view, url) method can be used to intercept the webView on any redirections to PayPal. This function returns a boolean that can be used on the shouldOverrideUrlLoading() method in the webViewClient. Example of WebView integration with your own webViewClient. // MainActivity.class WebView webView = new WebView(this); //SampleWebViewIntercept is your webViewClient. webView.setWebViewClient(new SampleWebViewIntercept()); // SampleWebViewIntercept.class public class SampleWebViewIntercept extends WebViewClient { // Include this for integrating with Checkout.js. @Override public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) { super.onPageFinished(view, url); // This will load a script to handle the Checkout.js integration. PayPalWebViewUtils.getInstance().loadScript(view); } @Override public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, final String url) { return PayPalWebViewUtils.getInstance().shouldOverrideUrlLoading(view, url); } } Direct Invocation Start the PayPal Checkout Experience directly, by providing a Payment Token from the back office system. Set a call back delegate, when the checkout has completed. paypalEnvironment.setPayPalService(new PayPalService() { @Override public void onApprove(HashMap<String,String> returnParams) { // Return params will contain all the required information for the merchant to finish the transaction. Log.i(\"CheckoutFinishedWith>>\", returnParams.toString()); // Here is a sample of what return params consists /** { returnUrl=https://sampleurl.com/checkouts/?from_cart=true&key=Key&token=EC-token&PayerID=payerID&opType=payment, token=EC-token, key=Key, PayerID=payerID } **/ } // In addition to the onApprove delegate you can also provide a onCancel delegate that is called when the user cancels the checkout process. @Override public void onCancel() { Log.i(\"Checkout Canceled>>\", \"Checkout Canceled\"); } }); Set additional params that you need to pass to PayPal. This is optional. // Every option should be a string with the key and value joined with a '=' String[] paypalParamsArray = new String[1]; paypalParamsArray[0] = \"useraction=commit\"; paypalEnvironment.setMerchantQueryParams(paypalParamsArray); Start the experience with the checkout token. PayPalCheckout.getInstance().startCheckout(\"sampleCheckoutToken\"); Dropping the delegate. In the event you need to drop the delegate from our callbacks, you can use final PayPalCheckoutConfig paypalEnvironment = PayPalCheckoutConfig.getInstance(this); paypalEnvironment.clearCheckoutDelegate(); To recieve events again, simply set the delegate again. No Native UI Mode The secure browser method, implements a sandboxed in app browser (Chrome Custom Tab), and eases the integration required for a developer. This path also implements the PayPal Risk library. To disable the UI, simply set the webBrowserOnlyMode on the Environment object. Example of WebView Intercept with no webViewClient. final PayPalCheckoutConfig paypalEnvironment = PayPalCheckoutConfig.getInstance(this); // This will ensure that the native UI is not called paypalEnvironment.setWebOnlyMode(true); Example of WebView Intercept with your own webViewClient with. //MainActivity.class final PayPalCheckoutConfig paypalEnvironment = PayPalCheckoutConfig.getInstance(this); // Set environment for internal testing. // paypalEnvironment.setPayPalEnvironment(PayPalEnvironment.SANDBOX); paypalEnvironment.setPayPalRedirectURL(\"sampleapp://paypalpay\"); paypalEnvironment.setClientId(\"AX93NErgg-sampleClientID_registeredForTheApplication-VD4GP-AJdjT0Uz4\"); // Optional param to only show web experience. // paypalEnvironment.setWebOnlyMode(true); WebView webView = new WebView(this); // Provide webViewClient for your WebView. webView.setWebViewClient(new SampleWebViewIntercept()); // SampleWebViewIntercept.class public class SampleWebViewIntercept extends WebViewClient { // Include this for integrating with Checkout.js. @Override public void onPageFinished(WebView view, String url) { super.onPageFinished(view, url); // This will load a script to handle the Checkout.js integration.
